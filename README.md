## React with Redux Seed Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In addition to what 'Create React App' offered, here has been added the router, redux, and some simple examples in order to get started fast.

## Local mock server
I have added a local mock server with some data using 'json server'

## Get Started
**See it in action**
```
$ npm install
$ npm install -g json-server
$ json-server -p 8080 --watch data.json
$ npm run start
$ npm run test
$ npm run test-coverage
```
## What can you do in the app
- Add item
- Remove item
- Edit item (by clicking on it, click enter after you finish updating it)

## Features
- Loading spinner (home component only)
- Items list
- Local mock server
- Router
- 404 page (eg: http://localhost:3000/TryToFindMe)
- Redux (store, actions, reducers)

## Get deploy code
```
$ npm run build
```
